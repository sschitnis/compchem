1. Locate the path to the interpreter for the language you are writing in with the which command.

e.g."which bash", "which python", etc.

2. Add that path as an interpreter directive (using #!) on the first line of your script. For example if you want to write a node script and which node returned /usr/local/bin/node, the first line of your script should be: 

"#! /usr/local/bin/node"

3. Give script execute permission:

"chmod u+x scriptname.sh"

4. Move script to one of the directories on the path. You can discover which directories are in your path by typing "echo $PATH" into the command line, which will print a colon seperated list of each of the directories in your path. A common directory in the path for scripts you've written is /usr/local/bin/

For cedar in my case I moved the script to /home/chitnis/bin/ using the command below:

"cp script.sh /home/chitnis/bin/"

Note: you may have to create the /home/username/bin directory if it does not exist. This can be done by 

"cd /home/user/"
"mkdir bin"

5. The script can now be called upon globally by simply typing its name
